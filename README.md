## HOME LOAN DEFAULT

To address the problem statement for the Home Loan Default dataset, I followed a structured approach. Here is a step-by-step plan to tackle the tasks effectively:


## Step 1: Data Analysis Report
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Load and explore the datasets.
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
   - Handle categorical variables and convert them to numerical values if necessary.

2. **Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualization**
   - Generate descriptive statistics for each dataset.
   - Visualize the distribution of key variables using histograms, box plots, and bar charts.
   - Examine the relationships between features using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
   - Investigate the target variable distribution (default vs. non-default).

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features that might be helpful for the predictive model.
   - Aggregate data from different tables to the main dataset (`application_train.csv`).

4. **Data Merging**
   - Merge datasets such as `bureau.csv`, `bureau_balance.csv`, `POS_CASH_balance.csv`, `credit_card_balance.csv`, `previous_application.csv`, and `installments_payments.csv` with the main dataset.

5. **Analysis of Significant Features**
   - Identify features that are most correlated with the target variable.
   - Conduct hypothesis testing to understand the significance of these features.

## Step 2: Predictive Modeling
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Normalize or standardize the data if required.

2. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Train various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
   - Perform cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
   - Compare the performance of different models and select the best one for production.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Analyze the importance of different features in the best-performing model.
   - Identify key factors and customer segments that are likely to default.

### Model Comparison Report
**Performance Metrics**
   - Create a comprehensive report comparing the performance of all models and select best fit model.
